# Microwave-OS-ComputerCraft-
Microwave OS: THE LIGHTWEIGHT

Microwave OS is an OS made in for CC:tweaked (lua) that for now is just decorational, but soon i planning to add:
* Something like apps
* Working GUI
* Easter Eggs
* More Compatibility

Check out my other OS!

Uhhh, this is all... idk what else to write here.

Yeah I forgot, here's the PASTEBIN CODE: https://pastebin.com/GxEWWGS1

Also,
Instructions for how to install:
* Go to a cc tweaked PC that doesn't have a file named startup.lua
* type: pastebin get GxEWWGS1 startup.lua

# What's the main idea/reason?
I always had a "potato pc" and in minecraft the advanced computer lags a bit, so for me it's difficult to program but the normal one works just fine so this OS is meant for the normal pc that's crafted with andesite and a glass pane but it works also with the advanced one same way!

# Why Microwave?
Because I always said that the normal computer has the same computing power of a microwave and because it sound funny
